# Scaling Study

## Project Description

Given a digital elevation map we compute the number of pixels visible from each pixel in a 100-pixel
radius. This information is then stored in an image format similar to input format, where each pixel
value represents the number of visible pixels that it can see. An example output of this is given
in Figure 1.
