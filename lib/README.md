# lib Directory

This directory contains core project utilities and third-party library code used by the project.

## Contents

* **`core.hpp`**:
  * A central header for this project.
  * Defines common type aliases (e.g., `vec3_i16`, `mat_2d_i16` using `Kokkos::mdspan`), utility functions for file I/O (`read_input`, `write_output`) and data conversion (`to_span`), and includes frequently used standard and third-party headers.

* **`span.hpp`**:
  * A header-only implementation of C++20's `std::span`.
  * Provides a non-owning view (a "span") over a contiguous sequence of objects, like data in a `std::vector` or a C-style array.
  * Sourced from Tristan Brindle (TCB).

* **`mdspan.hpp`**:
  * A header-only implementation of C++23's `std::mdspan` (based on proposal P0009).
  * Provides a non-owning view over multi-dimensional data, which may or may not be contiguous in memory, according to a specified layout (like row-major or column-major).
  * Sourced from the Kokkos project's reference implementation.
